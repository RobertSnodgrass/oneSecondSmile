It's cool that you're here and all.  Really, I don't mind.  You probably think I do because of the overly familiar tone this page is taking, direct address to the reader.  Viewer.  Websurfer.  Keyboardling.  

Bob doesn't really understand what he's doing all the time.  He just started talking about himself in the third person.  This is because reasons.  Reasons are everything.  I did it for the reasons.  Always the reasons.

I'm a little too nervous, always.  I can be reached at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
